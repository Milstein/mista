Changes and bug fixes 

June 20-24, 2011

	Add analysis of transition liveness
	Refactor ModelPanel, preparing for graphical editor

June 28, 2011
	Refactor MIMPanel into abstract classes and subclasses for different model types
July 1, 2011

July 20, 2011
	GUI changes: Model - Console Area; MIM - Methods/Accessors/Mutantors tabs
August 3, 2011	
	Pipe3.0 - PrT
August 10, 2011 bug fix
    Problem: open a saved test data file and open a new xmid file, the previous test tree is removed and the test code
    is generated from the tree in the test data file.
    Fix: XmidEditor constructors - clean up test tree panel if the file being open is not a saved test tree file
August 14, 2011
	Graph editor for state machines and threat trees, based on Pipe
August 17, 2011
	Simulator for Petri nets and contracts
August 18, 2011
	"Petri net" was changed to "Function net"
August 23-27, 2011
	Support for English/Chinese, ISTA, Pige, PipePrT
August 28-29, 2011
	Table Cell Editor for multi-line cells 
September 6, 2011
	Fixed progress dialog - create modal dialog (invisible), create working thread, and then set dialog visible
September 10, 2011
	Import PNML file (with PNML or XML as file extension) for such tools as ProM and separate PipePrT net editor 	
	
V0.997	
September 28, 2011		      
	Arithmetic expressions: =, !=, <, <=, >, >=, +, -
	Multiple labels on one arc <label1> & <label2>
September 29, 2011
	New functions: *, /, %, isOdd, isEven
	Redefined syntax of number: positive numbers can be in the normal form or in strings; 
	negative numbers must be represented in strings (conflict with minus)
October 2, 2011
	Random test generation for function nets, contracts, and state machines		
October 3, 2011
	Configurable test node index. Using this ID may cause time/space problems when the search is deep, e.g., in random generation
	bug fix: MID.isFirable did not consider negation in precondition or guard condition
November 20, 2011
	Bug fix: continuous backtrack for multiple negative preconditions (inhibitor arcs) in Unifier.handleSuccessfulUnification
	ModelPanelVisualNet.getPrecondition: bidirectional arc, directed arc, inhibitor arc.

	JTable for MAC
	Minimum rows of spreadsheets
	Platform independent window size 
12/15, 2011
	Total/partial ordering of concurrent/independent firings - results can depend on the ordering of transitions/events and places.
	Pairwise combinations for applicable transitions (more than two inputs with distinct variables, no negation, no guard condition)
12/20, 2011
	Keyword-based testing framework Robot Framework
12/21, 2011		
	Color text in keyword annotations

	Hierarchical nets
1/07/2012
	Goal tags
1/09/2012
	Registration via email
1/12/12
	home states - reachability analysis and state coverage tests	
	
V1.0	
1/22/2012
	logging of simulation traces, which can be used for test generation from given sequences
1/24/2012
	online testing via JSON-RPC and XML-RPC
1/28/2012 
	Analysis of on-the-fly tests: 
    State coverage, transition coverage, shortest paths to failure states		
2/02/2012 
	Online testing with Selenium WebDriver
2/03/2012
	Dummy variables in goal markings 
2/05/2012
	Dummy variables are replaced by more general goal specifications (called goal properties)
	Variables, predicates, and negation are allowed. Such a goal specification is similar to the precondition and guard condition of a transition.
